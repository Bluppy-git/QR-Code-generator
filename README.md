# QR-Code-generator
If you want to create a QR-code, you can youse my QR-Code generator. It's easy to use because of the graphical user interface .

You can decide if you want to wownload the App Folder(.exe) oder the python script.

If you don't want to install Python or the modules, you can download the App folder with the .exe file. (The .exe has to be in the App-folder otherwise the programm wouldn't work)

# Usage of the QR-Code generator interface

When you launch the .exe file you will see 4 white fields.
In The first one You have to enter The text you want to pack into the QR-code.
In the second field you have to enter the site the generated QR-Code should have.
Example: 10 for a small QR-code or for example 50 if you want a large QR-code.
In the third field you have to enter how far the QR-code is away from the image-border.
And in the Last field, you have to enter the Name the QR-code will be saved with.
If you have done this, click on the Button "generate QR Code". This will generate you the QR-code.
The generated QR-Code you can find in the same Ordner as the .exe or the python file.
