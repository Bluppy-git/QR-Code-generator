# QR-Code-generator
If you want to create a QR-code, you can youse my QR-Code generator. It's easy to use.

You can decide if you want to wownload the App Folder oder the python script.

If you download the python skript, you have to install the two modules below.

If you don't want to install Python or the modules, you can download the App folder with the .exe file. (The .exe has to be in the App-folder otherwise it wouldn't work)

The generated QR-Code you can find in the same Ordner as the .exe or the Python script


# Modules to install
